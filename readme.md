My 5th project and last project for foundations was quite a challenge; even after successfully implementing it, there's still some bugs that I couldn't fix. Not going to waste a lot of time on this projectðŸ˜…. Despite all that I have learned a lot and everything that I went through the entire foundations, there's more to learn after all this, and I'm looking forward to it.
